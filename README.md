# httpAWS: a CLI, [cURL](https://curl.haxx.se)-like tool for [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com) services

httpAWS is a command line HTTP client for AWS services. Its goal is to make CLI interaction with AWS web services as 
human-friendly as possible. It provides a simple ``httpaws`` command that allows for sending HTTP requests to AWS 
services using a simple and natural syntax, and displays colorized output. httpAWS can be used for testing, debugging, 
and generally interacting direly with AWS services with HTTP requests.

httpAWS directly makes HTTP calls to AWS service endpoints using the [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org) and 
[aws-requests-auth](https://github.com/DavidMuller/aws-requests-auth) modules.

This is a low-level command-line tool intended for use by developers so that they can easily make direct HTTP calls
to AWS services.  It is effectively a command-line programmatic replacement for using a graphical tool like 
[Postman](https://www.getpostman.com) and was inspired by tools like [HTTPie](https://httpie.org) but is specific to 
AWS services.

**WARNING**: *This tool is intended for development and educational purposes*.  It is NOT intended for robust and reliable
administration of AWS services.  For interaction with production AWS services, it is highly recommended that you use an
officially supported tool specifically designed for that purpose such as any of the following:
- [AWS Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console)
- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
- [AWS Shell](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-shell)
- [WS SDK for Python (boto3)](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-python/)

# Main Features
- Expressive and intuitive syntax
- Formatted and colorized terminal output
- Built-in XML support
- Python 2.7 and 3.x support
- Linux, macOS and Windows support

# Installation
A universal installation method (that works on Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, â€¦, and always provides the latest version) is 
to use [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/):

```sh
# Make sure we have an up-to-date version of pip and setuptools:
$ pip install -U pip setuptools

$ pip install -U httpaws
```

# Usage
Hello World:

```sh
$ httpaws -s ec2 DescribeVpcs
```
The above command calls the **DescribeVpcs** API on the EC2 service using the credentials and default region found in
your *~/.aws* directory.

Synopsis:
```sh
$ httpaws [flags] <API>
```

See also ``httpaws -h`` for detailed help:
```sh
httpaws -h
usage: http_aws [-h] [-r REGION] [-s SERVICE] [-e ENDPOINT] [-c CREDS]
                [-v VERSION] [-p] [-w]
